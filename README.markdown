Tangerine for iOS
-----------------

Welcome to tangerine-ios based on Couchbase-lite

This project works slightly different than most couchbase-lite apps as the couchbase-lite
project is included as a subproject. Because of this you need to deal with multiple
levels of submodules. These submodules relies on several forks.

Clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/jeffrafter/tangerine-ios.git

Go into the project and get the first layer of submodules

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

This should fetch both couchbase-lite-ios and Tangerine-community.

Now you need the submodules for couchbase-lite

    cd couchbase-lite-ios
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

At this point you should be able to open the XCode project. Compile for the iOS 7.0 iPad
simulator. Everything should run and you should see some logging saying that

    2013-09-26 00:51:23.548 Tangerine[68848:a0b] Listening on http://localhost:59840/tangerine/_design/tangerine/index.html#login
    2013-09-26 00:51:23.620 Tangerine[68848:a0b] View loaded
    2013-09-26 00:51:23.622 Tangerine[68848:a0b] Database loaded
    2013-09-26 00:51:23.624 Tangerine[68848:a0b] View loaded

All you should see is a white screen with a Start button. If you click that now, you'll
see a 404 and then need to restart the app. At this point you'll want to setup the
couchapp. There are three strategies for this:

1. Replicate from a local or remote couchdb (in AppDelegate change #define noreplicate to replicate)
2. Load from a bundled cblite (in AppDelegate change #define nobundled to bundled)
3. couchapp push to the running server

# couchapp push

Change to the Tangerine-community/app directory. You'll need to
create a .couchapprc file:

    {
      "env" : {
        "default" : {
          "db" : "http://admin:password@localhost:59840/tangerine"
        }
      }
    }

From this point you should be able to push (from the app folder)

    $ /usr/local/share/python/couchapp push
    2013-09-26 00:58:21 [INFO] Visit your CouchApp here:
    http://localhost:59840/tangerine/_design/tangerine/index.html

Back in the simulator, clicking Start (and waiting a very long time) will yield an orange bar (sometimes).
It should give you a login screen (where you can use the credentials: admin/password).

If you want to see what is happening you can change CBLHTTPResponse.m to EnableLog

    EnableLog(YES);
    EnableLogTo(CBLListenerVerbose, YES);

You'll notice that you see a lot of logging for the many attachments (scripts/images/css) and generally
you will see a final:

    01:20:13.850â€– CBLListenerVerbose: Response[GET /tangerine/_design/tangerine/images/corner_logo.png] sending nil bytes

The file may vary but you will see a "sending nil bytes".

# replicate

In order to try the replication option you'll need to have a local couchdb running. You'll also need a user
added to Futon with the credentials admin/password (or you can change the references in the code to a real
user).

Change the port in your .couchapprc file in Tangerine/Tangerine-community/app/.couchapprc so it points
to your local couch db (5984 by default):

    {
      "env" : {
        "default" : {
          "db" : "http://admin:password@localhost:5984/tangerine"
        }
      }
    }

From this point you should be able to push (from the app folder)

    $ /usr/local/share/python/couchapp push
    2013-09-26 00:58:21 [INFO] Visit your CouchApp here:
    http://localhost:5984/tangerine/_design/tangerine/index.html

On your simulator, make sure you have exited the app (Shift+Cmd+H is the Home Button), and delete it (click and hold
the Tangerine icon until you see the (x) and delete it.

In AppDelegate.m change the #define at the top:

    #define replicate 1

This makes it so that the app will replicate on load. Run the app. The replication should be very fast. Once the
logs show that it is loaded, click the Start button. You should see the login screen and should be able to
log in using admin/password (note: the user name is case sensitive and the username box tries to autocapitalize
Admin).

Turn replication off in AppDelegate.m

    #define noreplicate 1

# bundled

In order to use the bundled database you need to checkout the bundled branch.

On your simulator, make sure you have exited the app (Shift+Cmd+H is the Home Button), and delete it (click and hold
the Tangerine icon until you see the (x) and delete it.

In AppDelegate.m change the #define at the top:

    #define bundled 1

This makes it so that the app will copy the bundled database on load. Run the app. The copy should be very fast.
Once the logs show that it is loaded, click the Start button. You should see the login screen and should be able to
log in using admin/password (note: the user name is case sensitive and the username box tries to autocapitalize
Admin).

Now that the database exists, when you open the app it will not re-bundle. However you can turn bundling off
in AppDelegate.m

    #define nobundled 1
